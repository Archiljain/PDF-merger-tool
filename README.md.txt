# 🧷 PDF Merger (GUI-based)

This is a simple Python tool to merge two PDF files using a graphical file picker (Tkinter). The program allows users to select two PDFs and merges them into a single file called `merged_pdf.pdf`.

## 🚀 Features

- GUI-based file selection using `tkinter`.
- Supports all `.pdf` files.
- Merges two PDF files into one.
- Lightweight and easy to use.

## 📁 How It Works

1. A file dialog will open to select the first PDF.
2. Then, another dialog opens to select the second PDF.
3. The program merges both PDFs and saves the output as `merged_pdf.pdf`.

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- [pypdf](https://pypi.org/project/pypdf/)
- `tkinter` (usually comes pre-installed with Python)
